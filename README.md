# Solutions Architecture Case Study

## Overview
This repository documents the architecture and design decisions for a real-world system used to manage ______________________.

The goal of this case study is to demonstrate systems thinking, architectural tradeoffs, and practical design decisions — not just implementation details.

---

## Problem Statement
The system exists to solve the following problems:

- 
- 
- 

Key constraints:
- Regulatory / compliance requirements
- External system dependencies
- Operational reliability
- Cost sensitivity

---

## Users & Stakeholders
Primary users:
- 

Secondary stakeholders:
- 

External systems:
- 

---

## System Context
High-level view of system boundaries and external integrations.

See: `/01-context/system-context.pdf`

---

## Architecture Overview
This system is designed around the following principles:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Decoupled integrations
- Auditable data flows
- Operational simplicity

See: `/02-architecture/high-level-architecture.pdf`

---

## Data Flow
Key data flows include:
- 
- 
- 

See: `/02-architecture/data-flow.pdf`

---

## Data Design
The system uses a relational data model optimized for:
- Transactional integrity
- Clear ownership
- Reporting flexibility

See: `/04-data/er-diagram.pdf`

---

## Security & Compliance
Security and compliance are architectural inputs.

Key considerations:
- Authentication & authorization
- Least privilege
- Auditability
- Data access controls

See: `/05-security/auth-and-compliance.md`

---

## Failure Modes & Tradeoffs
This system explicitly considers:
- External service failures
- Partial data writes
- Retry vs consistency tradeoffs

See: `/02-architecture/failure-modes.md`

---

## Automation & Internal Tooling
Operational efficiency is supported via internal tools and automation.

Examples:
- Admin dashboards
- Status monitoring
- Manual override workflows

See: `/06-automation/`

---

## Design Decisions
Key architectural decisions and rationale are tracked here:
- `/decisions.md`

---

## What I Would Improve Next
If given more time or scale requirements:
-

---

## Final Notes
This case study reflects real-world constraints and tradeoffs.
The design prioritizes clarity, reliability, and maintainability over theoretical perfection.# solutions-architect-case-study
